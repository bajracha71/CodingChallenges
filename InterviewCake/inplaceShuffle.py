# In-place shuffle
# # **************** # 

# Write a function for doing an in-place â†´ shuffle of a list.

# The shuffle must be "uniform," meaning each item in the original 
# list must have the same probability of ending up in each spot in the final list.

# Assume that you have a function get_random(floor, ceiling) for getting a random 
# integer that is >= floor and <= ceiling.

        if index != index2:
            intList[index], intList[index2] = intList[index2], intList[index]
